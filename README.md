[filemap](https://filemap.xyz/) solves the problem of sending and receiving files to and from non-tech people when you don't have a text communication channel with them.

Imagine you want to send files to your grandfather, or you don't use Facebook and your younger cousin who only uses Facebook and doesn't know what is email wants to send you some pictures, it's pretty hard to get a file-sharing channel between people if they're not in the same network. If even the people have a way to upload the files to some hosting service and then share the link everything would still work, but you're not going to write `somehostingservice.com/wHr4y7vFGh0` to your grandfather -- or expect your cousin to do that for you and send you an SMS with dozens of those links.

Solution:
  * Upload your files to https://filemap.xyz/ (you can either upload directly or share links to things already uploaded -- or even links to pages) and pin them to your grandfather's house address; then tell your grandfather to open https://filemap.xyz/ and look for his address. Done.
  * Tell your younger cousin to visit filemap.xyz and upload all the files to his address, later you open the site and look for his address. There are your files.
